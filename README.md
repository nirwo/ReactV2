Alright, let's start by laying out the core files and their purposes:

1. `server.js`: This file will act as the entry point for our Node.js server. It will handle the file upload and the search endpoint.

2. `router/api.js`: This file will contain the API endpoints for the server.

3. `controllers/fileController.js`: This file will contain the logic for handling the file upload and parsing the xlsx file.

4. `controllers/searchController.js`: This file will contain the logic for searching the parsed xlsx file.

5. `client/src/App.js`: This is the main file for the React application. It will handle the file upload form and the search functionality.

6. `client/src/components/SearchBar.js`: This file will contain the search bar component.

7. `client/src/components/PivotTable.js`: This file will contain the pivot table component.

8. `client/package.json`: This file will contain the dependencies for the React application.

9. `package.json`: This file will contain the dependencies for the Node.js server.

10. `client/src/styles.css`: This file will contain the CSS for the React application.

Now, let's start creating the files:
